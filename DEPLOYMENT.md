✅ MongoDB Connected
```

✅ **Backend updated with frontend URL!**

---

## 🗄️ Part 4: Configure MongoDB Atlas

### Step 4.1: Update Network Access

Your backend needs to connect to MongoDB from Render's servers.

1. Go to **https://cloud.mongodb.com/**
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project
4. Click **"Network Access"** in the left sidebar (under Security)
5. Click **"+ ADD IP ADDRESS"** button
6. In the popup, select **"ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE"**
   - This adds `0.0.0.0/0` to the whitelist
7. Add a comment: `Render Backend Access`
8. Click **"Confirm"**

**Security Note:** For production, you can whitelist only Render's IP ranges instead of 0.0.0.0/0.

### Step 4.2: Verify Database User

1. Click **"Database Access"** in the left sidebar
2. Ensure your database user exists and has **Read and write to any database** privileges
3. If not, click **"Add New Database User"** and create one

### Step 4.3: Verify Connection String

Your connection string should look like:
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Make sure:
- Username and password are correct
- No special characters in password (or URL-encoded if they are)
- Cluster name matches your actual cluster

### Step 4.4: Check Render Logs

1. Go back to Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. Look for this message:
   ```
   ✅ MongoDB Connected: cluster0.tueadbc.mongodb.net
   ```

If you see connection errors, double-check your MongoDB URI in Render environment variables.

✅ **MongoDB configured!**

## ✅ Part 5: Test Your Deployment

### Step 5.1: Test Backend Health

Open a new browser tab and visit:
```
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Server is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-17T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

✅ If you see this, backend is working!

### Step 5.2: Test Frontend

Visit your Netlify URL:
```
https://your-site-name.netlify.app
```

You should see the login page with no errors.

### Step 5.3: Test Login

Try logging in with demo credentials:

**Super Admin:**
```
Email: superadmin@example.com
Password: admin123
```

**Manager:**
```
Email: manager@example.com
Password: manager123
```

**User:**
```
Email: user1@example.com
Password: user123
```

### Step 5.4: Test Full Application Flow

After logging in as admin:

1. ✅ Dashboard loads with statistics
2. ✅ Navigate to "User Management"
3. ✅ Click "Create User" and add a new user
4. ✅ Edit the user you just created
5. ✅ Check "Activity Logs" - should show your actions
6. ✅ Test "Export Report" button
7. ✅ Navigate to "My Profile" and update your info
8. ✅ Logout and login again

If all these work, your deployment is successful! 🎉

## 🌱 Part 6: Seed Database (If Needed)

If you need to add demo users to your production database:

### Option 1: Using Render Shell

1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click **"Shell"** tab (top right)
4. Wait for shell to connect
5. Run this command:
   ```bash
   node seed.js
   ```
6. Wait for completion message:
   ```
   ✅ Database seeded successfully
   ```

### Option 2: Run Locally with Production Database

From your local machine:

```bash
cd server
MONGODB_URI="your-production-mongodb-uri" node seed.js
```

Replace `your-production-mongodb-uri` with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string.

**Demo Users Created:**
- Super Admin: superadmin@example.com / admin123
- Manager: manager@example.com / manager123
- User 1: user1@example.com / user123
- User 2: user2@example.com / user123

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: CORS Error

**Solution:** Ensure `CLIENT_URL` in Render matches your Netlify URL exactly (no trailing slash).

### Issue: MongoDB Connection Failed

**Solutions:**
- Verify MongoDB URI is correct
- Check Network Access allows 0.0.0.0/0
- Ensure database user has read/write permissions

### Issue: 404 on Frontend Routes

**Solution:** Netlify redirects are configured in `netlify.toml`. Ensure the file is in your repository root.

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working

**Solutions:**
- Redeploy after adding environment variables
- Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- For Netlify, ensure variables start with `VITE_`

### Issue: Render Service Sleeping (Free Tier)

**Note:** Free tier services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. First request may take 30-60 seconds to wake up.

**Solution:** Consider upgrading to paid tier or use a service like UptimeRobot to ping your API every 10 minutes.
